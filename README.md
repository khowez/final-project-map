## Assessing Heat Vulnerability in NYC

Hot weather is dangerous. In New York City – and across the country – more people die from heat than from all other natural disasters combined. As our climate continues to warm, we expect more heat events that can put people’s lives at risk.
In New York City, the risk of death from heat is unfairly distributed across neighborhoods. The city's Department of Health and Mental Hygeine has identified environmental and social factors associated with increased risk to create a Heat Vulnerability Index.

These factors include:
* Surface temperature
* Green space
* Access to home air conditioning
* Income
* Race and Ethniity

The goal of this analysis is to identify neighborhoods at highest risk and help inform neighborhood-level policies and programs that can protect people - sending resources to where they're needed the most.

## About the Heat Vulnerability Index

The Heat Vulnerability Index shows neighborhoods whose residents are more at risk for dying during and immediately following extreme heat. It uses a statistical model to summarize the most important social and environmental factors that contribute to neighborhood heat risk. The factors included in the HVI are surface temperature, green space, access to home air conditioning, and the percentage of residents who are low-income or non-Latinx Black. Differences in these risk factors across neighborhoods are rooted in past and present racism.
Neighborhoods are scored from *1 (lowest risk)* to *5 (highest risk)*.

## Racial Disparities in Heat Vulnerability

In NYC, Black people die of heat-related illness at a disproportionately high rate. Because of this, neighborhoods with more Black residents are more greatly impacted by extreme heat.
Black New Yorkers suffer these disproportionate health impacts from heat due to social and economic disparities. These disparities stem from structural racism, which includes neighborhood disinvestment, racist housing policies, fewer job opportunities and lower pay, and less access to high-quality education and health care.

Overall, these systems limit access to resources that protect health. While many factors affect a neighborhood’s heat risk, Black New Yorkers are subjected to higher rates of poverty and lower access to air conditioning, green space, and neighborhood cooling resources.
